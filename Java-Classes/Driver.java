    4 pillars of Object Oriented Programming
    "A PIE" - Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation

    Encapsulation - logical bundling of two things, data and behavior, into an "encapsulation" that we call a "class"
        as well, an encapsulation's data or state should only be modified or accessed via the encapsulation's behaviors
    Abstraction - the hiding of complex implementation details, and instead exposing a simplified interface

    Inheritance - re-using the data and behaviors from another encapsulation, which can then be extended or modified
    Polymorphism - "many forms" - The idea that objects can behave differently or be used differently depending on
        context. Many things emerge from this principle, including:
        method overriding
        method overloading
        sub-type polymorphism
